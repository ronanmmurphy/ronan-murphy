## My Personal Profile

This repository is my website server for https://www.ronan-murphy.com/ which is a portfolio of my career, achievements and ambitions. I designed this with user engagement as the main focus. I also wanted to create a site which is responsive across devices and that is accessible to all users. Making the site accessible involved choosing text contrast, alt-text for images, font-size and type, and many other features included in https://www.w3.org/ AA principles.

The site is programmed from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. Bootstrap and FontAwesome styles were implemented to enhance appearance and AOS animations to add fade and slide features. 
To keep it simple for users all the content is on one scrollable page with different sections. 

The main content is divided into 7 sections:

Landing Home: 
This is a 2 column design landing section which includes a large portrait of myself and a text column with my name, job title, and a link to my resume. The key here was keeping it simple but effective in design where the user can easily understand the content while having a nice diagonal gradient across the page. 

About Me: 
Here I wanted to give a brief overview about myself and personal hobbies and interests as well as some high quality images in a interactive slideshow. 

Experience: 
This animated timeline shows an eye catching view of my work experience and education in an informative and minimalistic manner. 

Projects:
I have three subsections of projects which contain 4-8 projects in each, all linking to github repositories of code. This highlights areas of interest and experience and gives the user an oppurtunity to see some of the code I have written. 

Achievements:
This a an accordion of the most important achievements of my life acadmeically, through sports and volunteering. There are a variety of results and images which give a personal flair to the section. 

Skills:
My main skills and techonologies used are shown here in a two column format with animated icons and text descriptions. These show what I can bring to a team or project and that I'm most interested in AI.

Contact:
The final section provides various ways to get in contact with me through a number of social media links, telephone, email and even a map of my home town. This gives the user the ability to reach out if they have any questions, concerns or just want to chat!


I'm using Google Analytics and Hotjar to monitor user behaviour and feedback. The Analysis tools allow me to improve the website's user experience and performance/conversion rates.
